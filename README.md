## Diary Farm Production Forcast

This project focused on forecasting dairy farm production using the Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors (SARIMAX) model. The objective is to predict future milk production levels by analyzing historical data and incorporating relevant external variables.

**Features:**

* **Data Collection and Preprocessing** : Scripts to collect, clean, and preprocess dairy production data and relevant exogenous factors.
* **Model Training and Evaluation** : Implementation of the SARIMAX model, including parameter tuning and performance evaluation.
* **Forecasting** : Scripts to generate future production forecasts based on the trained SARIMAX model.
* **Visualization** : Tools to visualize historical data, model performance, and forecasted production levels.

**Steps:**

1. Clone this repo
